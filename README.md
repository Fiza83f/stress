# stress
This project detects stress from text using NLP and Machine Learning. After preprocessing, features are extracted with CountVectorizer and TF-IDF. Models like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, KNN, and Random Forest predict stress. Grid Search and Voting Classifiers improve accuracy and performance.
